This project is developed as a part of the CodTech IT Solutions Internship Program, focusing on the implementation of file handling operations using the C programming language. The goal of this task is to build a menu-driven program that allows users to perform basic file operations such as creating a file, writing data to it, appending new content, and reading from it. These operations are implemented using standard functions from the C library, including fopen(), fputs(), fgetc(), and fclose(). File handling is a key concept in C programming as it introduces how software can interact with the file system to store, modify, and retrieve data.

This kind of program has a wide range of real-world applications. File handling is used in scenarios such as saving and loading data in text editors, maintaining logs for software or system events, reading configuration files, or even storing results and progress in console-based applications like games or simulations. For example, when you open or save a file in an application like Notepad or a code editor, file handling operations occur in the background. By understanding these operations, programmers can build their own custom tools that interact with files, enabling persistent data storage without the need for a full database system.

The code for this project was written and executed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a widely used and highly efficient source code editor. It is supported on multiple operating systems and integrates well with compilers like GCC. On a Windows system, GCC was installed using MinGW to compile the C program from the terminal. The terminal built into VS Code allows users to compile their C files with a simple command like gcc file_handling.c -o fileprog, which generates an executable file. Running this file in the terminal then launches the menu-based application. The use of VS Code enhances productivity due to features like syntax highlighting, error detection, and integrated debugging support.

To run this program, you must ensure GCC is installed on your machine. Save the code into a file named file_handling.c, then open the folder containing the file in VS Code. Use the integrated terminal (Ctrl + ~) to compile the file with the gcc command. Once compiled, run the program using the generated executable file (e.g., .\fileprog on Windows or ./fileprog on Linux/macOS). The code is configured to use a default file named "codtech_file.txt", but it can be modified to use any custom filename as needed. This project serves as a strong introduction to file handling in C and is especially helpful for beginners who are just getting started with systems programming. It demonstrates practical applications of C and builds a foundation for more advanced file-based or data-driven software development tasks.
